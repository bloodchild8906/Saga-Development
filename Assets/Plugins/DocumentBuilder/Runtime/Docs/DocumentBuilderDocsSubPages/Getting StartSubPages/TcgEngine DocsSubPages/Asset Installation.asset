    - 'URP Only ?

      I would strongly recommend to use URP for a card game. 
      HDRP would be overkill for this type of game since it''s more aimed at more
      realistic 3D games, and the built-in pipeline would prevent you from using
      cool features such as shader graph or some post-processing effects.

      

      Built-in
      Pipeline is still supported (in 1.01+), if you choose to use Built-in pipeline,
      go in the TcgEngine/Materials folder and import the Built-in material package.

      

      Scripts
      will also work in HDRP, but the demo FX are currently not supported on HDRP.'

      HUB trying to convince you to change Unity Version when you reopen the project,
      please do not downgrade Unity Version, as it will break any Unity project,
      you can only upgrade Unity version. Sometimes Unity Hub still tries to make
      you downgrade to the Unity version this asset was created with (because of
      a Unity bug in some Unity Versions that override unity project version when
      importing project settings). If Unity Hub changed your Unity Version on your
      project, just reset it to the one you originally used to install the asset.
      This Asset should work on ALL unity versions after 2020.3.37 (including it),
      as long as you don''t downgrade after importing.

      

      UI works
      but Dropdown don''t, that could be because the project settings were not imported
      so the Sorting Layers are not set properly. I created a script to add the missing
      sorting layers automatically, it will be available in 1.02. If you are not
      on that version you can ask me the script on Discord or email. Or you can try
      reimporting the asset and accept the override project settings.

      

      UI
      not responding to any click in Menus, could be because you have the Input System
      installed while the template uses the built-in input. You can safely remove
      the Input System Package in Package Manager. Otherwise, if you want to keep
      it for your project:  you just need to go in Edit-Project Settings-Player-Other
      Settings : Active Input Handling and set it to "Both" (If you don''t have the
      Input System package this should be set to Input Manager instead).'
